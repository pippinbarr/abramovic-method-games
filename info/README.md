# Abramović Method Games

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.
